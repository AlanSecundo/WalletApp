## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- **Database File**: The app requires a `db.json` file for proper functionality. However, this file is not included in the repository. Ensure it is added to the project root before running the application.
- **Platform Support**: Development and testing were limited to Android due to the lack of access to macOS for iOS testing.

## üìù **Development Considerations**

### **Time Spent**

- The project took approximately **10 to 12 hours** to achieve its current state.

### **Limitations**

- **iOS Development**: Unable to test or configure and develop due to lack of access to a macOS device.

## üö¶ **Future Improvements**

- Add full support for iOS, including testing on physical devices.
- Implement Google Analytics or New Relic for production-ready logging.
- Add a local database (SQLite) to store logs for offline traceability.
